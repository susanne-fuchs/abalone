    # Findings:
    # - Length, diameter and height are approx. linearly related.
    # - Whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and shell weight are approx. linearly related.
    # - Weight and approximated volume (l*d*h) are linearly related.

    # Tried multiple models for regression:
    # Decision tree, linear reg., mixed linear and polynomial reg, sequential neural network.
    # The NN showed the best results: RÂ²=0.65, MAE=1.3, RMSE=2.0
